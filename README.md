# ComicMTL
App that translate whole manga into prefer languages. Currently In development.

Note: The web app will be removed. I will only develop the app for desktop and mobile in the future due to IP blocks encountered while trying to scrape some sources.
- Most of the APIs and modules will be changed and rewritten for client-side only.
- A backend might not be required.

Beta Testing: https://comicmtl.netlify.app/
