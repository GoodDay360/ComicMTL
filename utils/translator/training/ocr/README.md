# Custom CTC Loss
CTC Loss but in addition to a classification label per time step we have an additional set of real values as targets (assume Gaussian distributed) per time step and a new BLANK1 symbol for masking real value targets.
# How this is used in OCR?
We use 6 real values to predict color of font and border color per character, we use space character as BLANK1 symbol.
